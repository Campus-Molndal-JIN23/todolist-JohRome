# Project name
TDDproject

## Description
- School assignment for QA course. A simple little todo app to demonstrate the use of MongoDB, JUnit 5 and Mockito
- The app is a simple todo app that allows the user to add, remove and edit todos in your local MongoDB. The app also allows the user to mark tasks as done and undone.
- I learned how to use JUnit 5 and Mockito to test my code.

## Reviews on this project. 

### People that started the program and gave feedback
- Samer.I - Said the program worked, was written in a way so the user could understand what the methods are doing. No errors were found.
### People that reviewed code without running the program
- Kristoffer.L - Said it would be better to pass dependency injections instead of creating new objects in the Application class. - Under Progress
- Emil.S - Said the code was easy to read and understand. Was unsure about test coverages. Thought it would be better to clean up showTodoMenu() method. - Done
## Tests
- Usage of Mockito and JUnit 5 to test the code.
- Each test is runnable, and you can run them all at once or one by one, by clicking the green play button.
